I am a front-end specialist and a software designer with 8 years of professional experience acquired on multiple projects and technologies. I love new challenges and I don't hesitate to seek knowledge in areas that are not in my comfort zone, be it visual effects programming or even music playing.

I have also a personal commitment to hackers, doers communities. That's why I contribute to the organization of the parisian javascript community [Paris.js](http://parisjs.org) and I co-organize every year the web-only demoparty, [DemoJS](http://demojs.org).

I'm always looking for new opportunities to widen my horizons. Right now, I'm full stack developer with a strong proficiency on front end technologies, but technologies are just a means to an end so who knows what I will be doing in a few years.

You can find more about me or how to contact me on my [linkedin profile](//lnkd.in/pGpKxY).
